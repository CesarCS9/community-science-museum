# AI Usage Log

## Tool Used
ChatGPT (OpenAI)

------------------------------------------------------------

### Date Range
February 2026 (week 6 to week 9)

-----------------------------------------------------------

### Purpose of Use
AI was used strictly as a learning support tool during development. The main uses included:

- Explaining HTML and CSS concepts
- Debugging layout and responsive issues
- Understanding accessibility practices
- Brainstorming naming conventions for classes and components
- Reviewing wording for report writing
- Clarifying GitHub and deployment workflows

-----------------------------------------------------------

### Outcome
The explanations helped improve understanding of front-end development concepts. All code was written, adapted, and implemented manually after understanding the solutions.

No AI-generated code was copied blindly into the project.

-----------------------------------------------------------

### Reflection
AI was used as a learning companion similar to a tutor or rubber duck debugging process. The experience reinforced understanding rather than replacing problem solving.
