# Report Notes

Notes and reflections will be added throughout the project to support the final report

- Adjusted navigation and hero layout during prototyping
- Simplified long text from brief into scannable card content
- Applied mobile-first thinking before starting CSS
- Optimized image sizes to meet performance requirements

- Responsive design required adapting layouts instead of strictly following the prototype
- Small UX decisions improved clarity and navigation
- Accessibility testing helped refine form labels and navigation elements

## Final Reflections

- Working mobile-first helped prevent major responsive issues later
- Reusable components simplified styling across pages
- Debugging responsive problems improved understanding of CSS structure and specificity
- Testing with accessibility tools helped identify issues not visible during development
- Project organization at the beginning made development smoother compared to previous projects
